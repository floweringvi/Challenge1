# Accesibility Challenge

## Description

During this challenge, I went through and made both the HTML and the CSS more accesible. I did this by using tags with more specificity, adding alt attributes to img tags, reducing the length of the CSS file by removing and consolidating classes and ids. Now when inspecting or opening this code, things will be more clear.
